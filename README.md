As the description says, this is for roll 20 and a Pro account is needed as it enables you to use custom character sheets.
Just go to the settings of your game and scroll down to find "Character Sheet Template" and select 'Custom' (This is only found when you have a PRO subscription in your Roll20 account, otherwise you can only select the library of Character Sheets that Roll20 has approved and able to be used by anyone without a subscription)
My tip for anyone who wants to use a custom character sheet (even for other custom character sheets than this) on Roll20 is just to buy a PRO subscription for one month and make two or more games that have the same character sheet so you can use the other ones as backup. When your PRO subscription expires, the custom character sheet stays in the game and remains functional, just that you cant edit or change it to a different one.

This is in no way, shape, or form a better alternative or to be competed with the Twilight 2000 4th Edition Character sheet that's readily available in Roll20 made by NocFenix.
It's really up to you but this is just my own preference and was originally just for our small group of friends. I'm not really a great programmer just yet or anything, my code might not even be optimized, I have only about a year of experience with HTML and JavaScript.
This was originally planned to have rollable buttons and other automations, but I kinda found the template making and macros of roll20 somewhat overwhelming especially with it's limits. Not that I think it's too difficult or that I can't do it, it just would be very time consuming and confusing too look around at, plus we just decided to use the Sebedius Discord Bot for rolls.
I probably won't continue this or so, depends if I feel like picking up on it to finally add tempplates, rolls, automations and whatever. If anyone wants to pick up from this then feel free to do so.

(Please don't think otherwise that I made this out of spite or against anyone especially the sheet author, NocFenix, even though I really did make this because there are just some things I preffered)
The difference of this character sheet are as follows;
* Everything is on one page, you just scroll around
* DOES NOT HAVE AUTOMATIONS OR FUNCTIONING ROLL BUTTONS
* Health Status are quickly found on the top (except for radiation, injuries, and diseases)
* Damage Capacity and Stress Capacity checkboxes are limited to 6
* Character Avatar and Token are on the top as well for quicker identification
* Didn't include an age input because I tried to style this as close as possible to the actual character sheet of Twilight 2000 4th Edition, only to be set back by Roll20's limits 
* Specialties are repeated fieldsets and areon the very bottom because they tend to take a lot of space with their description and makes it irritating to have to scroll past them to get to the other stuff
* Weapons and Gear are all on repeated fieldsets as well so you can add and modify what items there are in your inventory
* Weapon weight and item weight on Carried and Worn are all summed up and return as current carry weight so you don't have to list up your weapon or armor in both the weapons section and the carried gear section.
* Cap input on the gear section mostly represents Ammo capacity, but if you have some sort of house rule that makes a consumable item like water have 2 or more uses than just one use and its gone from your inventory then you can use cap to represent that.
* Worn gear was somewhat a stylistic choice but it should represent as armor and the Cap should represent how much armor does a worn piece of gear would give. Should name your armor as something like "Atlyn (Head)" since there's no input field for that

Also, this doesn't have all the attribute names being similar with NocFenix's sheet so if you're gonna migrate your character to this then it might not have everything set up and you'll have to manually copy and paste them from the attributes and abbilities area.
